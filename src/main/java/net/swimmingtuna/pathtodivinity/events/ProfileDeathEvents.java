/**
 * Owns sequence regression and the Beyonder Characteristic drop on death while the profile system is enabled.
 *
 * <p>Normal profiles drop a sequence when another player kills them; Safemode profiles never do, on either side
 * of the kill. A Safemode player neither loses a sequence when killed nor takes one when killing, which is the
 * whole trade: Safemode gives up Sequence 0, half its ability damage against players and its own progression in
 * exchange for staying out of the regression game entirely. Regression by other means is untouched — notably
 * the Sun/Bard Sequence 4 purification, which regresses through {@code BeyonderHolder.setSequence} directly
 * rather than through death, and so keeps working against Safemode players. The same is true of any future
 * ability that states it can regress someone.
 *
 * <p>The characteristic drop lives inside the regression branch rather than beside it, so a Normal player killed
 * by a Normal player drops exactly one characteristic on exactly the deaths that cost them a sequence. Nothing
 * drops inside the ten minute grace window and nothing drops when {@code Normal Profile Regresses On Death} is
 * off — LOTM puts its own drop ahead of the equivalent check, which would let two players trade kills inside the
 * window and farm characteristics for free.
 *
 * <p>Runs at {@link EventPriority#HIGH}, which is a deliberately narrow window. LOTM cancels the death outright
 * in three {@code HIGHEST} handlers — {@code pallorDeathPrevention}, {@code wraithDeathToUnderworld} and
 * {@code inextinguishableLightDeathPrevention} — so regressing at {@code HIGHEST} would race them and could
 * take a sequence from a player who then survives (a Sequence 0 Sun using Inextinguishable Light, for
 * instance). Sitting at {@code HIGH} puts this after every canceller and still ahead of LOTM's own
 * {@code deathEvent}, which runs at {@code NORMAL}. Because {@code LivingDeathEvent} is cancellable and this
 * listener does not opt into receiving cancelled events, Forge skips it entirely when the death was prevented.
 *
 * <p>The Safemode-victim and Normal-regression branches finish by calling
 * {@link SequenceRegressionProtectionLayer#putRegressionTimer}, which does double duty: LOTM's handler skips its
 * regression block whenever that timer is non-zero, so this suppresses LOTM's path — preventing a double
 * regression if an operator ever turns on {@code Should Drop Characteristic} — while also granting the usual
 * grace window. The Safemode-killer branch deliberately does not, for the reason spelled out at its call site.
 *
 * <p>Always use LOTM's helper rather than writing the {@code sequenceRegressionProtectionTimer} NBT key by hand:
 * the helper also registers the tick layer that counts the timer back down. Setting the raw tag alone would
 * grant permanent immunity.
 *
 * <p>That LOTM timer cannot carry the grace window on its own, which is why the Normal-regression branch also
 * stamps one of its own through {@link ProfileManager#startRegressionGrace}. The timer lives in the player's
 * persistent data, and Forge carries only the {@code PlayerPersisted} subtag across a respawn — so the respawn
 * that follows a death erases the window that death just opened, and the victim can be killed again
 * immediately. Before the second stamp existed that was measured at eighteen seconds between regressions,
 * which made the drop farmable at one characteristic per kill. PTD's stamp lives in {@link PlayerProfileData}
 * instead, so it survives respawn, logout and restart. Both are checked before regressing.
 *
 * <p>The window's length is {@code Regression Grace Minutes}. Setting it to 0 turns it off outright — no
 * stamp, no check, every player kill regresses and drops — which is meant for testing, since it restores
 * exactly the farm the window exists to prevent. Safemode is unaffected either way; its suppression timer is
 * the constant below, not this setting.
