/**
 * Guards LOTM's {@link BeyonderHolder#onPlayerRespawn} against an inconsistent holder
 * state where the pathway (currentClass) is set but the sequence is still the constructor
 * default of -1.
 *
 * <p>This state is produced on respawn when Obscure API is present: its
 * {@code PlayerDataCapability$EventBusHandlers.clonePlayer} calls
 * {@code event.getOriginal().invalidateCaps()} in the middle of {@code PlayerEvent.Clone},
 * which interferes with LOTM's capability copy and leaves the new player's holder
 * half-initialised. {@code SpectatorAttributes#applyAll} then does {@code healthList.get(-1)}
 * and throws {@code ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index -1 out of bounds for length 10}.
 *
 * <p>This is the mixin equivalent of adding {@code && holder.getSequence() >= 0} to the
 * {@code pathway != null} guard inside {@code onPlayerRespawn}: when the holder is in the
 * broken state, we skip the (crashing) modifier re-application for that respawn instead of
 * editing LOTM's source.
