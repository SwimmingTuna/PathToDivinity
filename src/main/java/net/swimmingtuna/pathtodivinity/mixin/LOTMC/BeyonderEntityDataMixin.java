/**
 * Makes mobs pick their abilities at the sequence they are registered with in
 * {@link BeyonderEntityData}, i.e. the one given to
 * {@code /beyonderentity add <entity> <pathway> <sequence>}, instead of the sequence from
 * {@code BeyonderUtilMixin}'s entity map.
 *
 * <p>{@code selectAndUseAbility} builds its candidate list from
 * {@code BeyonderUtil.getAbilities(mob)}, which gates every ability on
 * {@code BeyonderUtil.getSequence(mob)}. Because {@code BeyonderUtilMixin} overrides that method
 * for all callers, a mob registered as e.g. {@code lotm:spectator 3} was still handed the
 * sequence 1 ability set (the ultra sniffer being the obvious case). The pathway half of the
 * decision already came from {@link BeyonderEntityData}, so the two halves disagreed.
 *
 * <p>Only this one call is scoped: the mapped sequence still applies everywhere else (spirituality
 * regen, ability cooldown length, damage scaling, other mods reading the sequence).
