/**
 * Keeps Safemode players out of LOTM's capped sequence slots.
 *
 * <p>With {@code Only One God} enabled, {@code Sequence0Data} allows just one Sequence 0 holder per pathway per
 * world (plus three at Sequence 1 and nine at Sequence 2). {@code BeyonderUtil.setSequence} and
 * {@code setPathwayAndSequence} both funnel their slot bookkeeping through
 * {@code updateLimitedSequenceSlots}, which is the one place to intercept.
 *
 * <p>A Safemode profile carries no PvP risk, so letting it occupy a capped slot would let a risk-free player
 * lock a Normal-profile player out of a high sequence. Safemode therefore claims nothing.
 *
 * <p>Returning {@code true} matters: the method's contract is "the slot bookkeeping succeeded". Returning
 * {@code false} makes the caller abandon the sequence change entirely, which would stop Safemode players
 * advancing at all.
