/**
 * The look this mod's screens are drawn in: LOTM's own panel style, with a few flourishes of its own.
 *
 * <p>The first five colours below are lifted from the LOTM mod's screens rather than invented, so a screen of
 * ours sits next to the pathway and sequence menus without announcing that it came from somewhere else.
 * {@code PathwayBaseScreen} fills its panel with {@link #PANEL_BODY} inside a two-pixel border, insets its
 * description box in {@link #SUB_PANEL}, and rules it off with {@link #DIVIDER}; {@code FixedScaleScreen}
 * washes the whole screen in the {@link #BACKDROP_TOP}–{@link #BACKDROP_BOTTOM} gradient first.
 *
 * <p>Everything here draws with plain rectangles. No textures and no glyphs, so a resource pack cannot
 * replace the frame with something else and no ornament can come out as a missing-character box.
